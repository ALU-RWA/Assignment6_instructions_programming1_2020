<h1>Assignment 6</h1>

Congrats again for making it this far :), lets have fun<br>
This assignment is all about giving more juice to our previous code of assignment 5<br>
What we are testing here is how well we understand inheritance and how well can we implement it<br>
Also we are testing how do we make sure that our code is working perfectly.<br>


<h2>Question 1</h2>
Thanks to your help, Mr Omondiâ€™s business is doing even better.<br>
Now he want to expand his business into Moto renting<br>
Motos still have the same data as cars, but for motos because they have helmets,<br>
he needs to be able to know the number of helmets available for that moto.<br>
Mr Omondi is worried about the planet and he would like to calculate the carbon footprint of every vehicle.<br><br>
The formula for carbon footprint calculation is:<br>

<i>Car</i><br>
	Number of years since released *12000(average miles per car yearly)*15 (gallons per mile)
	*9 (grams of co2 per gallon)<br><br>

<i>Moto</i><br>
	Number of year since released*10000(average miles yearly)*2(gallons per mile)*9(grams /gallon)

<h3>Expectations</h3>
I will need you to submit the following files<br>

main_program_file :<br>
which has the control flow of your program<br><br>

vehicle_file :<br>
containing the parent vehicle class<br><br>

Test_vehicle_file :<br>
containing the function calls of all the functions created in the vehicle class<br><br>

car_class_file :<br>
containing the car class<br><br>

car_class_test_file:<br>
containing the method calls of all the methods you created in the car class<br><br>

moto_class_file :<br>
containing the moto class<br><br>

moto_class_test_file :<br>
containing the method calls for the moto class<br><br>

This makes the total of 7 files.<br>


<h3>Grading rubric</h3>
	this Question is worth 50 marks<br>
	Having the correct file structure (5)<br>
	Explaining the algorithm (5)<br>
	Explaining the testing process (15)<br>
	Code working perfectly (20) <br>
	Appropriate commenting : (5)<br>


<h2>Question 2</h2>
Dangote is happy with your help so far, but he would like to make some changes.<br>
He would like to introduce saving accounts and current accounts.<br>
If you deposit money in a current account and the money stays for one month, you get an interest of 1%,<br>
but if you have a saving account,the interest is 3% and you can only withdraw after 6 months.<br>

<h3>Expectations</h3>
Here too I expect a total of 7 files<br><br>

	Structured in the following way<br>
	main_program_file :<br>
	containing the control flow of your whole program<br><br>

	bank_account_file :<br>
	contains the parent bank account class<br><br>

	bank_account_test_file :<br>
	containing method calls of all the methods you created in the bank account class<br><br>

	saving_account_class_file :<br>
	containing the saving account class<br><br>

	test_saving_account_class_file:<br>
	containing method calls of all the methods you have created in the saving account class<br><br>

	current_account_class_file:<br>
	containing the current account class<br><br>

	current_account_class_test_file:<br>
	containing the method calls of all the methods you created for the current account class<br><br>

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>
	this Question is worth 50 marks<br>
	Having the correct file structure (5)<br>
	Explaining the algorithm (5)<br>
	Explaining the testing process (15)<br>
	Code working perfectly (20) <br>
